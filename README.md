You can also load custom exploits of your choice! This is the Default template inside of `exploits` folder filaname.py:

```py
from core.modular import Module

class Exploit(Module):

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize an Exploit object with default attributes.

        The attributes 'name', 'description', 'author', and 'creation_date' are initialized
        with example values for demonstration purposes.

        self.name should be the same as the file name.

        You can create more functions and call them inside of Execute same goes for classes.
        """
        self.name           = "commandname"
        self.description    = "Example description of this exploit."
        self.author         = "Username"
        self.creation_date  = "00-00-1337"

    def execute(self):
        """
        Placeholder method for the exploit's execution logic.

        Subclasses of Exploit must override this method to define the specific behavior
        of the exploit when executed. This method may return data or perform actions.
        """
